#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Software Engneering can be defined as the systematic application of engineering approach applied in building high quality software products. it can also be defined as the process of designing, creating, testing and maintaining software applications by using systematic methods and practices.

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
The importance of software engineering in today's world of technology can be seen in the creation of various software applications like banking apps, social media apps etc. Software engineering is important in the tech industry because it helps create reliable, efficient, and secure software. It makes sure that software works well, is easy to update, and can handle growing demands. It also helps developers avoid costly mistakes and keeps the software safe from cyberattacks. Plus, it ensures that software is user-friendly, meeting people's needs and improving their experience. Overall, it's key to building the tech we rely on every day.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Structured Programming (1960s): In the early days, coding was often done in a chaotic and unstructured way, which made it hard to manage large projects. Then came the idea of structured programming, where developers started to use a more organized approach—breaking code into smaller, manageable parts (functions or modules). This made it easier to read, understand, and maintain the code.
2. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s): As software became more complex, object-oriented programming (OOP) was introduced. This approach allowed programmers to create objects that represented real-world entities, making the code more flexible and reusable. It helped solve problems in a more logical way, and OOP is still widely used today in modern software development.
3. Agile Methodology (2000s): Before Agile, software projects often followed a rigid, step-by-step process, which could lead to delays and inflexible results. Agile flipped this by focusing on delivering smaller pieces of the project in short, regular cycles. This allowed for faster feedback, easier adjustments, and ultimately, more successful and user-friendly software. Today, many software teams work in this more flexible and adaptive way.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement (Planning and Analysis): This is where the team figures out what the software needs to do, sets goals, and plans how long it will take.  looks closely at what users want the software to do and writes down all the details.
2. Design: The team creates a blueprint for how the software will look and work, from the layout to the database.
3. Implementation (Coding): Developers write the code to build the software based on the design.
4. Testing: The software is tested to catch any bugs or issues and to make sure everything works correctly.
5. Deployment: The software is launched and made available for people to use.
6. Maintenance: After launch, the team keeps the software running smoothly by fixing issues and making updates.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a step-by-step approach. when one phase is finished e.g planning or coding completely before moving on to the next. For example: Building software for a space mission might use Waterfall because every detail needs to be planned and tested in a strict order, with no room for quick changes once the rocket is built.
Agile is more flexible. Instead of finishing everything in one go, it's planned in short cycles (called sprints) to create small parts of the project. This can helps to adjust, Update and improve on the project. It’s like making a product bit by bit, testing it along the way, and making changes as needed. for example: Creating a social media platform could use Agile. The team can roll out new features, test them with users, and make adjustments as feedback comes in, allowing the platform to evolve quickly.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer: Writes the code to build the software. They take the designs and turn them into a working product by programming features, fixing bugs, and making sure everything runs smoothly.
2. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Tests the software to catch any bugs or issues before it’s released. They make sure everything works as it should and that the user experience is good. They help ensure the software is reliable and high-quality.
3. Project Manager: Keeps the project on track. They coordinate between the team members, set deadlines, manage resources, and make sure everything is moving forward according to the plan. Their job is to ensure the project gets done on time and within budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) aided in the creation of other software applications, its provides space to write, compile and debug codes. it's used to write and edit code, find and fix bug,  run code and organize code into files and folders. Examples of IDEs are Eclipse, Visual Studio, BlueJ, Komodo etc.
Version Control Systems helps in managing the source code and tracking changes in code over time. Its help developers to see exactly what changes were made and when, lets multiple people work on the same codebase simultaneously and in case of lost code, it can be restore easily from a previous commit. Examples of VCS are , Git, Subversion, Gitlab, Bitbucket, Etc

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Keeping up the technology trends: It can be demanding to keep up with the latest trends and technologies. Best way to manage this is, by setting aside time each week to learn something new, attend weinars or conferences, and participate in online communities.
2. Debugging and troubleshooting: Finding and fixing can be hard and frustrating sometimes. Take a step back to avoid burn out, break down the problem, and approach it systematically. Use tools like print statements or debuggers to identify issues.
3. Meeting deadlines and managing time: Juggling multiple tasks and meeting up with deadlines can be stressful. It's best to prioritize tasks, create a schedule, and use time management tools like Trello. Don't e afraid to ask for help or extensions when needed.
4. Imposter syndrome and self doubt: Software Engineers can sometimes be overwhelm with self doubt, this can make them to hold back on their potentials. Recognize that everyone feels this way, focus on your strengths, and celerate your achievements. It's always good to seek support from mentors or peers.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing: This is the first level of testing and focuses on individual components of a program, like specific functions or methods. It helps ensure that each part works correctly on its own. It checkes if each Lego piece fits perfectly before building the whole model. It's essential because it catches issues early on.
2. Integration Testing: Once the individual units (pieces of code) are working fine, integration testing checks how these units work together. This is crucial because even if units work well on their own, they might not work as expected when combined.
3. System Testing: After testing smaller pieces and their interactions, system testing checks the entire software as a whole to ensure everything works properly from start to finish. It completes the Lego model and ensuring it stands solid and looks as intended. This type of testing verifies that the software meets all the technical and business requirements.
4. Acceptance Testing: This is the final stage, where the software is tested from the user's perspective. It's done to confirm whether the software meets the user's needs and expectations. It shows the completed Lego model to a customer and making sure they're happy with how it turned out. This step ensures that the software is ready for real-world use.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the art of crafting clear and effective inputs or questions for AI models to get the best possible responses. The better the prompt, the better the answer.
This is important because AI models,  rely heavily on the wording and context of prompt to respond with accurate answer. A well-thought-out prompt can make the AI give a more accurate, useful, or creative response. On the other hand, a vague or poorly phrased prompt might lead to less helpful answers. Prompt engineering helps to communicate better with Artificial Intelligence.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: "Tell me About Machine Learning"
Improved prompt: "Can you explain the Impact of Machine Learning on the evolution of technology over the past 10 years"
The vague prompt is too broad and not specific. Machine Learning is a Broad topic, this could result in an ambiguous response from the AI. The improved prompt is clear, specific and precise about the impact of machine learning on technology in today's world.
